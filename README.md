- 👋 Hi, I’m @NZRichard
- 👀 I’m interested in learning more about Open Core bootloaders for macOS, and contributing in any way I can. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning about Open Core 0.7.5 for use with macOS Big Sur/ Monterey
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on the editing and presentation of written material to better describe Open Core.
- 📫 I can be reached at rsampson1200@comcast.net
